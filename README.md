  This page gives a detailed overview of the brand — including its story, mission, values, and vision. It uses structured content and attractive design to connect emotionally with visitors.

- **Shop Page (shop.html)**  
  A visual gallery-style page where products (or sample items) are displayed using styled cards and images. Although not dynamic, it simulates a product listing layout and is fully responsive.

- **Contact Us Page (ContactUs.html)**  
  A user-friendly contact form is provided on this page, including fields like name, email, and message — allowing users to get in touch with the brand (form not functional, as it's a frontend-only project).

  A dedicated `/images` directory is used to store all static image assets like banners, product pictures, and logos — maintaining proper organization and reusability.
